# HelmBrigade


HelmBrigade is a [Brigade](https://github.com/Azure/brigade) Project that utilizes [Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm) [containers](https://hub.docker.com/r/lachlanevenson/k8s-helm/). 

## Prerequisites

1. Have a running [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/) environment
2. Setup [Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm) - this assumes Helm on your Host regardless of the Helm container used later on. 

## Install

### Set up Brigade

Install Brigade into your Kubernetes cluster is to install it using Helm.

```bash
$ helm repo add brigade https://azure.github.io/brigade
$ helm install -n brigade brigade/brigade
```

To manually run Brigade Projects the **brig** binary is required. Follow the
[Developers Guide](https://github.com/Azure/brigade/blob/master/docs/topics/developers.md)
